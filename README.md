## Synopsis

After a long night of visiting *questionable* websites, your computer has become infected with a legion of viruses! As we speak, the viruses are marching towards your computer's core in the hopes of destroying it. 

The core must be defended at all costs. If the viruses are successful, all your data is at risk! Your schoolwork, your gaming library, even your 2 terabyte folder of Big Chungus memes; all will be lost if the viruses breach the core!

Fortunately, you have tools at your disposal to help fight back against the viruses. You can place towers along the viruses' path to deal them some damage, and the core is equipped with a few abilities that will help you defeat the virus menace.



### The Towers

#### Basic Tower

I know he doesn't look very happy to be here, but I assure you that his level of artificial intelligence is too low to feel happiness, so don't worry! Equipped with only a basic launcher, this tower is the cheapest of the bunch. Don't let his low price fool you, however, he can still dish out some solid damage.


### Shock Tower

Inspired by everyone's favorite pigeon-obsessed father of electrical current, the shock tower constantly emits a cloud of electricity that damages viruses that are within its short range. 


### Sniper Tower

Sniper towers hit hard and have incredible range all at the cost of firing much more slowly than other towers. A worthy investment, the sniper tower has been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Qaeda and has over 300 confirmed kills.


### Shotgun Tower

This tower shoots a blast of projectiles that spread out in a small cone at enemies. While capable of dealing massive damage to enemies at close range if all projectiles hit, any projectiles that miss could possibly hit another enemy instead.

### Support Tower

While not dealing any damage itself, this tower buffs the damage of any towers it is next to. Sometimes even towers need a little support (especially that basic tower, look at how grumpy he is).
